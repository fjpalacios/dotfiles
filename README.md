# Dotfiles

This is a backup of all my configuration files. If you want to use it first
clone this repository in a new .dotfiles directory in your home, then run the
python script which do the magic!

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/fjpalacios/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ python ~/.dotfiles/makelinks.py
```

**Caution**: this script will replace all your configuration files and backing
up them in your new ~/.dotfiles_old directory. Make sure you want to do that
before running the script!
